How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    locating the bug and fast display tht location in the code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    see the different version and what changes are made over the time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	i have a fully control of the code. so there is no space for surprise. only cons is when i forget to commit ;-)  

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    relationship between the files are given by git. google docs handle every file as an own version

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all commits and versions in my project

    git diff shows me the difference between the commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i see every change in the code and can easy restore. also i can see when it started to break and what i have done since that time

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    using git for tracking and sharing projects. get an overview what i have done and when.
