When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?

- access to my repos from everywhere
- sharing the project gives all features from the remote repo

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- still controll of my code. i can check the commit and decide if i want to pull or not
 
 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- forks: creates a existing repo hosted on github to my accoutn to edit or modify
- clone: downloads a existing repo to my local machine also to edit or modify
- branche: creates a new "label" or version to work with without destroying the original repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- it offers me an opportunity to merge the repos with the local repo. also easy way to access the remote without having a connection

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- we are working with dropbox. we always have to remember to update the work. there is no clean structure.
- easiest way is still github. we will start using after this course
- hard is the situation when more peoples are working at the same time and finish the work and want to pull it together
